            <p>The basic queueing model it's just a queue line and server. Waiting line queue is where the customers form a waiting line. 
              The order for a line queue is usually first in first served. A queue is formed when customers arrive faster than they can get served. <br><br>
            <img src="/images/Untitled-2.png" class="container">
            Example:
            <ul>
              <li> Service time = 5 minutes, a customer arrives every 10 minutes. <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>No queue will ever be formed</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> Service time = 10 minutes, a customer arrives every 5 minutes. <br>
                <ul>
                  <li>Queue will grow forever. </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

              </ul>
            <title2>Arrival Characteristic</title2>
            <br><br>
            <p><i>Population sizes</i> are considered either unlimited(infinite) or limited (finite). When the number of customers or arrivals 
              on hand at any given moment is just a small portion of all potential arrivals, the population is considered infinite.
              Most queueing models assume such an infinite arrival population.
            </p>
            <p>For the <i>arrival process</i> of costumers usually we assume that the interarrival times are independent 
              and have a common distribution. In many practical situations customers arrive according to a Poisson 
              stream (exponential interarrival times). But there are other cases where customers may arrive one by one or in batches. 
            </p>

            <title2>Queue/Service Discipline</title2>
            <br><br>
            <p>The lenght of a queue line can be either limited or unlimited. There are many possibilities for the order in which they enter service:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>FIFO - First In First Out: who comes earlier leaves earlier</li>
                <li>LIFO - Last Come First Out: who comes later leaves earlier</li>
                <li>RS - Random Service: the customer is selected randomly</li>
                <li>Priority -  Item or customer is given priority in the queue</li>
              </ul>
            <title2>Service Characteristic</title2>
            <br><br>
            <p>Service systems can be classified in terms of their number of channels (servers) and number of phases.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Single-channel</b> queueing system, where you have one line and a single server.</li>
                <li><b>Multiple-channel</b> queueing system, where each customer or item is waiting in one common line but with several servers</li>
                <li><b>Single-phase</b>, the customer or item receives service from only one station and then exits the system.</li>
                <li><b>Multiple-phase</b>, the customer or item receives service from several stations before exiting the system.</li>
              </ul> 
            <p><i>Service pattern</i> are pretty similar to arrival patterns in that they may be either constant or random. Service times and inter-arrival
              times are rarely constant. From read data we can construct a histogram of the service time 
              and the inter-arrival time. If read data is not available, then we assume a theoretical distribution. A commonly used theoretical 
              distribution in queueing theory is the exponential distribution. </p>
            <title2> Stability Condition:</title2>
            <br><br>
            <p>A queue is stable, when it does not grow to become infinite over time. The single-server queue is stable if on the average,
               the service time is less than the inter-arrival time.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"> Mean service time < mean inter-arrival time</p>

            <p>Kendall introduced a shorthand notation to characterize a range of these queueing models:</p>
            <p><em>A / B / c / K / n / D,</em></p>
            <p>Where</p>
            <p>A: interarrival time distribution</p>
            <p>B: service time distribution</p>
            <p>c: number of servers</p>
            <p>K: capacity of the system</p>
            <p>N: population size</p>
            <p>D: service discipline</p>
            <p>When describing the distribution we use: G for a general distribution, M for exponential distribution
               ( M stands for Memoryless or Markovain ) and D for deterministic times.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In the basic model, customers arrive one by one and they are always allowed to enter the system,
               there is always room, there are no priority rules and customers are served in order of arrival.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>M/M/1 queueing system is the simplest queueing system where the requests arrive according 
              to a Poisson process with rate &lambda;, that is the interarrival times are independent, 
              exponentially distributed random variables with parameter &lambda;. The service times are 
              also assumed to be independent and exponentially distributed with parameter &mu;.</p>

            <p>M/M/1 queueing system means there is one queue per server. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you can't
               have multiple servers. Which would mean if there are more servers, each of these are computed
                using M/M/1 queues. Example: 5 servers with 5 queues would be denoted as 5(M/M/1).</p>

            <p>M/M/c is when we have a single queue with more than 1 parallel server. M/M/c is pretty similar to M/M/1
               and it's important to realize the difference between them. In M/M/c queueing system we have k parallel 
               servers with a single queue, while in M/M/1 you can have multiple servers but for each server you need 
               to have a queue, for those you want to use the notation c*M/M/1. </p>

            <p>For this type of queue, we require a &rho; &lt; 1 for it to be stable. To get &rho; on this system we use
